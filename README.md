# Project: Image Classification with Transfer Learning and Data Augmentation

## What is this project about?

This project implements an image classification model using both transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture and training from scratch methods. The project explores different configurations, including:

- Training from scratch with and without data augmentation
- Transfer learning before and after fine-tuning, with and without data augmentation

The model is designed to classify images into 10 classes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with added layers for feature extraction and classification. It includes layers like Convolution, MaxPooling, Dropout for regularization, and Dense layers for classification.

This project showcases the impact of transfer learning and data augmentation on model performance, providing comparisons between various setups, which are reflected in metrics such as accuracy and loss.

## Info about the project

- The clean folder contains all notebooks without markdowns and outputs.
- The pdf folder contains all notebooks converted to PDF (both with markdowns and outputs, as well as without markdowns and outputs).
- The results file contains a table with the best results obtained from the different models throughout the study, for easy comparison of the results.
- The models that end with .h5 instead of .keras were trained on Google Colab, hence the different format. These models are discontinued, which is why no conversion was done on their format****.
